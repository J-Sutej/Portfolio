This repository represents my schoolwork and project.

1. SQL - This database associated with patient history, health care provider, vaccine product and vaccine history to build the interoperability of vaccine procedure.
2. Excel Dash board (Clean data bru) - This is a interactive dashboard displaying the positive case and number of animal infected brucellosis by Rose Bengal Test. To be honest, I cannot change to all documents to English as it reflects to the overall Dashboard.
3. Machine Learning (Linear Regression) - This project is reproducible project from Data Professor (YouTube) to predict the continuous variable in chemical substrate.
4. Machine Learning (K-means) - The project is performed in Intro to Programming Class that is open to student to express their ideas in healthcare data by using K-mean method. I choose to classify the diabetic patient's laboratory results.
5. DESeq 2 using R - The dataset is received from Bioconductor (library airway). It is read counts in genes for an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. I use DESeq2 from bioconductor and visualize in MA plot to see the upregulated and downregulated gene and heat map of read counts.
